I joined the Jakarta Ambassadors program
========================================

I have been doing spring for pretty much all my career. However, I always have had feelings for Java EE (now it is Jakarta EE). That's why I recently joined the [Jakarta Ambassadors](https://jakartaee-ambassadors.io/who-we-are/) program, mostly to learn and, incidentally, if I can contribute. So much exciting stuff going on in the Jakarta EE space. We have so many experience developers here, so if you want to contribute, please do or keep an eye on what's going on, try out and give feedback; that'd be great.
