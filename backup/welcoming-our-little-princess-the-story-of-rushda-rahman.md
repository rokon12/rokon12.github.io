Welcoming Our Little Princess: The Story of Rushda Rahman
=========================================================

We are excited to share the news of the arrival of our baby girl on January 2023. Choosing a name for our child was a thoughtful and meaningful process. We wanted a name that would reflect our values and hopes for our daughter's future. After much consideration, we chose the name **Rushda At-Taqwaa Bint Bazlur Rahman.**

**رشدة التقوي بنت بذل الرحمن**

**Rushda At-Taqwaa Bint Bazlur Rahman**

### The Meaning of Rushda At-Taqwaa:

The name Rushda has a deep meaning. Beyond its literal translation, it holds a broader significance. The word is derived from the Arabic word "Rashada (رشد)" which means path. It has given rise to various other words such as Rushd, Rushdi, Rasheed, Rashida, Rushdiya, etc. However, the general meaning of the word is a path. Rushda is a person who has found her path and can help others find their way. The context of the word may depend on the Arabic Balagh or occasionally on the context of a sentence.

To understand the relevance and origin of the word Rushda, we must first understand the concept of "Ilm al-Rushd" in Islam. Let us consider verse 14 of Surah Al-A'la:
> قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن تَزَكَّىٰ ١٤

While it is challenging to translate the Quran into English, a rough translation of the verse would be "The one who purifies oneself is successful." The direction to achieve this purity is called Ilm al-Rushd, which means attaining purification or piety. The first five Caliphs of Islam -- Hazrat Abu Bakr (RA), Hazrat Umar (RA), Hazrat Uthman (RA), Hazrat Ali (RA), and Hazrat Hasan (RA) were all knowledgeable and are referred to as the Khulafa al-Rashidun. They were all the rightful successors of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). The relevance of the words Rushda and Rushdaa lies in the quest for the right path. Rushd is used for males and Rushdaa for females. On the other hand, the word Taqwaa refers to Allah's consciousness and is related to Tazkiya and piety. All these concepts come together in the name Rushda At-Taqwaa, meaning "a path of Allah's consciousness found in the daughter of Bazlur Rahman."

Official and legal requirements such as birth certificates, passports, etc., will use the name "**Rushda At-Taqwaa Rahman** ." Middle names usually get omitted, so it will usually be **Rushda Rahman**.  
Choosing a name for our daughter was a significant decision, and we are proud to have chosen Rushda At-Taqwaa Bint Bazlur Rahman. It represents our values and hopes for our daughter's future, and we believe it will guide her on the path of righteousness. We hope our daughter will live up to her name and be a source of inspiration and guidance for others.
